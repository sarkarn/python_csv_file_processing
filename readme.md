This program generates the loci.csv with computed coverage value for each position.
In order to run this program, we need update the input location of the reads.csv and the loci.csv in the config.ini file.
We also need to update the output location of the generated loci.csv in the config.ini file.
The config.ini file can be found out under <project_root>\bli\coverage location.

To run the program, we need to go to <project_root>\bli\coverage folder in the command prompt, and then execute command "python CoverageCalculator.py".
In order to run the individual test class, we need to go to folder <project_root>\bli\unittest folder, and run individual Test class.
